    "The first step in the lecture towards the **vertical decompostion** was the **slab decomposition**. Essentially the problem is reduced to a one-dimensional problem, which can efficiently be solved using a balanced binary search tree. To reduce the problem we draw vertical lines through all vertices, which divides the instance into a set of vertical strips, also called slabs. Inside each strip there is a well-defined _bottom-to-top order_ on the line segments. Each strip is therefore a one dimensional problem in _y_-direction. If we know between which line segments of the strip our point is, we found the face of the subdivision containing the point. Finding the correct strip is also a one dimensional problem, this time in _x_-direction.\n",
