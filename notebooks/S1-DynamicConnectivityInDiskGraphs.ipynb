    "This notebook implements and presents the approach by Kaplan et al. [1] They give a solution to the following problem: Given a set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ sites in a plane, where every site $s\\in S$ has an associated radius $r_s > 0$, be $\\mathcal{D}(S)$ the disk intersection graph. Its vertices are the sites $s\\in S$ and there exists an edge between two sites $s,t$, iff the two disks at $s,t$ with radii $r_s, r_t$ intersect. A connectivity query then asks whether two given disks are in the same connected component.\n",
    "\n",
    "The presented approach requires $O(\\log^6 n)$ expected amortized time for adding a new disk and $O(\\alpha(n))$ amortized time querying the connected component for a given disk. For that they introduce a new data structure, the component tree $\\mathcal{T}_C$ and the insertion algorithm for adding a new disk to the tree. Both are presented in section 3 of this notebook.\n",
